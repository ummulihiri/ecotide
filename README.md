# ecotide

A decentralized platform connecting local communities for sustainable development projects using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

EcoTide enables communities to create, fund, and verify environmental impact projects in a transparent and decentralized way. The platform facilitates project creation, democratic governance, transparent funding, and verifiable impact tracking for sustainable development initiatives.

## Smart Contracts

### Project Registry (`project-registry`)

The central registry for all sustainable development projects on the platform. Manages:
- Project creation and lifecycle
- Project metadata and status tracking
- Project discovery by category and location
- Collaborator management

Key features:
- Multiple project categories (reforestation, clean water, renewable energy, etc.)
- Project status tracking (proposed, active, completed, cancelled)
- Collaborative project management with role-based permissions
- Searchable project directory

### Funding Pool (`funding-pool`)

Handles the transparent collection and distribution of project funds. Provides:
- Secure fund collection
- Milestone-based fund releases
- Community-approved disbursements
- Refund mechanisms for failed projects

Key features:
- Project funding registration
- Contribution tracking
- Milestone-based fund releases
- Refund mechanisms
- Transparent transaction records

### Community Governance (`community-governance`)

Facilitates democratic decision-making for project management. Enables:
- Project approval voting
- Milestone validation
- Fund disbursement authorization
- Community-driven decisions

Key features:
- Proposal creation and voting
- Multiple proposal types
- Voting power management
- Proposal execution tracking

### Impact Verification (`impact-verification`)

Creates a system for recording and verifying environmental impact. Provides:
- Impact claim submission
- Multi-stakeholder verification
- Impact metrics tracking
- Sustainability credentials

Key features:
- Impact type registration
- Claim verification process
- External data source integration
- Impact credentials issuance
- Carbon equivalent calculations

## Contract Interactions

The contracts work together to create a complete ecosystem:

1. Projects are registered in the `project-registry`
2. Funding is managed through the `funding-pool`
3. Decisions are made via `community-governance`
4. Impact is verified through `impact-verification`

## Getting Started

To interact with the EcoTide platform:

1. Create a project using `project-registry`
2. Set up funding parameters in `funding-pool`
3. Establish governance rules through `community-governance`
4. Track and verify impact using `impact-verification`

## Development

This project is built with Clarity smart contracts for the Stacks blockchain. Each contract is extensively documented with inline comments explaining its functionality.

To work with these contracts:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install Clarity tools
3. Deploy contracts to the Stacks blockchain
4. Interact using contract functions

## Security Considerations

- Multi-stakeholder verification required for impact claims
- Role-based access control for project management
- Community-driven governance decisions
- Secure fund management with milestone-based releases
- Transparent and immutable record-keeping
